You’ve seen this cat before, it’s pretty unmistakable from its white and speckled long haired coat of fur. It looks remarkably fluffy. Dangerously fluffy. Do you feed the cat part of your lunch? y/n"""

You can guess that they’re probably lost. They lock eye contact with you and immediately walk up to you to make conversation.“Hey, do you know which building room number #$@!% is?” Are you able to help this poor freshy brother out?"""
5,re_cult,Cult,You encounter the local school cult,60,,,,,,,Y/N Check,"""While wandering around the STEM side of campus, you start to get an ominous heavy feeling… Could this be the fabled and dreaded “bad vibes” so many of your classmates talk about when they mention the Chemistry and Physical Sciences department? Around the corner, by the Chemistry building, you notice two twin doors have seemingly opened on their own ( or someone pushed the handicap button…), almost as if they’re inviting your presence in. Throwing caution to the wind, mostly out of your own dumb curiosity, you head on in to the building.  The hallways of the building are dark, quiet and cold, even though class should still be in session at this time.  You are startled by a loud bang behind you, you turn around to see that the double doors have shut. Well, there’s no going back now.  You head to the end of the hall and see an open double door to a lecture hall auditorium. Low ominous chanting and bells can be heard beyond the door. You wander your way in only to see, not quite the most bizarre thing you've seen on campus but still pretty stange, what appears to be a demonic cult ritual being performed. There are around 20 or so people in black hooded cloaks, standing in a circle around some kind of magic circled adorned with candles. The projector is also on.  The projector is displaying what appears to be a zoom meeting with other cultists members who couldn't make it to the ritual, online education sure is convenient. “Ph’nglui, ph’nglui…” The hooded figure in the center, which appears to be the leader, greets you… There appears to be a person lying on the ground in the middle of the circle with a knife through their chest. They may or may not be dead, nothing wrong in keeping a healthy positivity. Will you join in on their dubious ritual?"""
