Krispy Kreme, Dunkin’, Winchels, Portos,  some ambitious students even brought coolers full of Dutch Bros, what… that’s… well that's quite the way to go for some frappes. They’ll all smile politely with the occasional “‘sup dude?” casual greeting, so that they can entice you to purchase a treat with the money going to their “charity” providing funds towards their fraternity or sorority coffer. Funds towards what? Why their yearly Big Bear trips of course! Come to think of it… you have been really craving something sweet at the moment.

The frat seems to be a collective of “a very certain type” of guys, with a kind of aura of neither being a normie or a cultured individual, but they look a little… behind the times. Oh of course! They’re from Fresno! That’s the only logical conclusion. Well, might as well. This frappe tastes “hella” artificial but there is kind of a charm to enjoying a traditionally normal treat in socal.

Around the corner, by the Chemistry building, you notice two twin doors have seemingly opened on their own ( or someone pushed the handicap button…), almost as if they’re inviting your presence in. Throwing caution to the wind, mostly out of your own dumb curiosity, you head on in to the building. The hallways of the building are dark, quiet and cold, even though class should still be in session at this time. You are startled by a loud bang behind you, you turn around to see that the double doors have shut. Well, there’s no going back now. You head to the end of the hall and see an open double door to a lecture hall auditorium. Low ominous chanting and bells can be heard beyond the door. You wander your way in only to see, not quite the most bizarre thing you've seen on campus but still pretty stange, what appears to be a demonic cult ritual being performed. There are around 20 or so people in black hooded cloaks, standing in a circle around some kind of magic circled adorned with candles. The projector is also on. The projector is displaying what appears to be a zoom meeting with other cultists members who couldn't make it to the ritual, online education sure is convenient. “Ph’nglui, ph’nglui…” The hooded figure in the center, which appears to be the leader, greets you… There appears to be a person lying on the ground in the middle of the circle with a knife through their chest.

You decide to join them in their ritual. “Iä! iä! n'gha, ghaa!” Their leader cries in excitement as they throw their arms up in the air laughing maniacally. A member throws you a robe that so happens to be your size.  You put it on and join the circle holding hands with the other members are you mouth the unknowable words to their chants. Every candle in the room burns out at once. The circle below your feet seems to glow red and purple. The ground starts to rumble rhythmically, this is no earthquake. It seems as if something truly evil has awoken from underneath UCSB... From the outside, the students of UCSB stand still in primal fear, as much as they could because of the earth-shattering tremors, as they witness the impossible... the unheard of. They stared upward. The sky is blood red with purple lighting crackling down. Black tar-like substance pours from the heavens above crashing down on earth. The students cower in fear and cover their ears as  blood-curdling high-pitched shrieks reverberate seemingly from nowhere, as if the earth was screaming out in pain. A gargantuan, vanta-black like claw bursts forth from the earth and raizes the surrounding buildings. Whatever sick unnatural creature is prying its way above to our home. It’s figure, indescribable and non-euclidian in nature, the students shrivel up and perish from fear, the few remaining continue to cry and beg for mercy from whatever has arrived. Ah. Okay. Hmmm.

You can see the millions of dancing verdant scales that line the giant's backs known as “trees.” Not only that but some of these giants have tiny, speckled, white caps of winter adorning their heads.

Maybe beings of this magnitude can only be measured by means that exist outside of human comprehension, at least it feels that way. You giggle to yourself as tears roll down your cheeks.

,are_fightclub,Fight Club,Question,You have the chance to fight for money,,,,,,,,,,,,,"“While on your way home, you find yourself walking upstream against the crowds of students making their way wherever they need to be. You feel someone shove against you, you can tell its crowded but not nearly crowded enough to warrant someone bumping into you. But when you tried to apologize, the person who bumped into you was nowhere to be seen. What you do notice however is there's a scrap of paper in your pocket that wasn't there before. “Looking for tough people, real badass type of people, can hold themselves in a fight kind of people. $1000 cash prize. Tournament style. No weapons, only rely on your fists. Whoever snitches gets stitches.” I.V Fight Club There's a time and address on the bottom Huh? Wha? They can’t be serious right? I thought we all stopped this Fight Club LARPing obsession in high school, right? It’s about toxic masculinity and anti-materialism, not “beating the shit out of dudes is cool” for christ's sake! But despite this… Your interest is piqued. If college is all about having life changing experiences then this is possibly a whole experience and a half awaiting you. Additionally… if they are not bullshitting, that looks like a tasty 1k, you could pretty much quit your job at that point and not have to work for the whole quarter! Will you do it?”"
,,Y: Hell yeah!,Response,Fitness check pass,,,,,-50,1000,,,>=20,,,,"“Well why the hell not!? Actually you can think of plenty of reasons why you would not but. That’s not the point. Sometimes the definition of ‘living a little” is beating up other random kids your age for the sake of entertaining other random sick kids your age, and this time there's cash involved, serious dough! You find your way to the place aforementioned in the flyer at the requested time. Its a small rotten looking old apartment that clearly is not a part of campus housing. It seems no one has followed you, but that doesn’t mean you can let your guard down. You knock at the door and wait a few minutes but there’s no answer. Maybe there’s no one home, unless… You slide the flyer under the door… and then the door opens to a tall dark man. He looks behind you to see if anyone followed you here, he then pats you down and confiscates your phone for the time being, you can have it back once your time is done here. He escores you into the building. Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, this is really happening!! This is really happening!? There’s no turning back after this. This feels like the final hallway before a boss fight. With no save points. The doorman opens up another door in the back of the hallway, sounds of cheering and music can be heard from within. You are led into the door and down a dark staircase, its completely dark and the sounds of excitement and high energy music gets louder. What meets you at the bottom looks straight out of an early 2000s, gritty, creatively-bankrupt, gray-washed and mid-budget action movie. In this dimly lit cellar, there is a crowd of various people, mostly students that are making a ring around what you can assume is some kind of fight between two people. Oh look, they even have a dj, playing either The Prodigy or The Crystal Method, you can’t tell but from the underlying amen break and the mix of electronia meets metal meets embarrassingly edgy rap, it’s something late 90s to early 2000s-ish. A match ends as quickly as it started with the opponent being picked up and literally thrown out of the ring. They’re knocked out cold and clearly down for the count. Is that blood coming from their mouth? Are they legit dead!? This appears to be less of a tournament and more of an endurance match with a single guy versus anyone dumb enough to want to flex on them. The dude is massive, like an absolute unit of a guy who looks more like a failed experiment in human cloning than an actual student? Do they even go here!? That looks like no twenty-something year old. “Do we have any other challengers in here tonight? Anyone? Any takers?” After witnessing that, it makes sense that no one would come forward after witnessing that. “Oh yeah, you! You over there who just came in! Ladies and gentlemen it looks as if we have a brand new challenger tonight? Can they bring an upset to the match and be crowned the new champion of Climax of the Saturday Night Under the Glass Moon Hyped Jam 20XX!!” Ah, now you know why you’ve been summoned here/ You weren’t selected based on if you looked tough, you were selected to be a jobber, a jabroni if you will! They brought you here to lose? You’re not gonna give them the satisfaction are you?” No! You’re not! Who the hell do these people think they are!? Not because they’re holding a secret, definitely illegal literal underground deathmatch, but because they’re underestimating you as easy money! You stride up to the ring with all the swagger of every point of charisma you have on you and stare down at the opponent who is clearly twice your size, the two of you circle each other like tigers going in for the kill. Tonight you’re gonna show everyone here the fruits of your labor. Someone is getting sent home in stitches, and it's not gonna be you. The announcer throws their raised hands down and you hear a classic boxing bell ding. The absolute unit of a man immediately starts charging towards you with an intent to kill. Alright, you wild animal, you think you can kill me? l Better make it count. Better make it hurt. Better kill me in one shot. Mustering all the strength you can in your fists, through the result of vigorous training, accounting for every point of Fitness you have ever gained, you meet the beast’s charge head on with your own fist, which is seeimling now red and on fire for no reason whatsoever. This will probably knock them into next week, next month, next year, straight up into several calendars into the future, maybe? An audible punch echoes through the basement… You stand triumphant over your opponent who is still laying on the floor staring into the ceiling shocked as to what just happened. The crowd is losing their minds, hooting and hollering at the great upset that transpired before their eyes. Several people hold you up as you crowd surf the people chanting the name of their new champion of the Fight Club. The celebration is short-lived as the organizer, clearly upset that their bet didn't go as planned, throws you out of the building. There's a short pause before a heavy duffle bag is thrown out as well and nearly hits you.  Well hot damn it looks like they weren’t joking about the prize money. Honestly if you were to wake up right now and it was actually all just a dream, you wouldn't be surprised. ( You lost a lot of stress. You gained $1000)”"

Actually you’re starting to regret even coming here. Let me out. Let me out. Let me out. Let me out! Did you see what that guy did to that dude, you’re definitely a goner! Like a pathetic startled gazelle, you dash through the crowd and back up stairs and run right out the door which slams behind you. You forget your phone on the way but it doesn't even matter anymore, that was a life or death scenerio baby and you chose to save your fucking skin! ( You lost $100. You gained a lot of stress.)”"
,,N: Hell nah!,Response,no check,,,,,,,,,,,,,"“This already goes without saying but this reeks of being a scam, this is practically spelling out, “come on over and get mugged!” But regardless if it’s true or not, this is still so lame! Come on guys, it's been almost 20 years since the novel and films release and it's still misinterpreted to death, really, in the current year of 20XX. Why don’t you go home and be a family man instead! You don’t have a “family” at the moment but your point still stands.”"
