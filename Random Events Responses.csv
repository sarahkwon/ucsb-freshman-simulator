2,re_cat_y,Y/N,Stray Cat Y,,,,,,,-10%,,,,,,,"""You give the fluffy cat part of your ham bagel to which its scarfs down in a single bite. It seems to have gained your trust by the way it circles your legs. You decide to pet the cat. Oh! Now that’s fluffy! ( You have relieved some stress )"""
2,re_cat_n,Y/N,Stray Cat N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""It looks like the cat is perfectly capable of finding its own food. Comparatively speaking, the cat seems to be doing fine for itself, as opposed to you, a poor broke starving college student."""
3,re_run_in_traffic_1,multiple,"""1: Seriously run through traffic.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,"""Here goes absolutely everything! As you charge headfirst in a full on sprint into the intersection, you can hear a mix of horrified cries, speeding cars and screeching tires. And before you could take another step further into certain death. A Silver 2022 Toyota Prius slams directly into you, at a speed and force so impactful, your body is severed in half, killing you instantly. It must have been going at least 100mph in a 20mph lane, those damn student drivers...Your blood and guts go flying like confetti and streamers as everyone in the vicinity is absolutely horrified and probably traumatized for life. And so your University of California Santa Barbara Freshman life comes to a close, with a bang! GAME OVER"""
3,re_run_in_traffic_2,multiple,"""2: Are you fucking kidding me?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""Who would actually do such a thing? Well maybe some seriously depressed people, or tweakers. And you’re neither, right? So clearly you have no reason to do such a thing! Perhaps you should see a counselor."""
3,re_run_in_traffic_3,multiple,"""3: Ask others if they wanna see you run through traffic.""",,,-1,,,,,,,,,,,"""“Who wants to see me run through traffic!” You exclaim loudly to passerbys around you. Nobody responds, with most outright ignoring you while others give you a concerned look or stink eye. What could you have possibly expected from this kind of interjection? You feel the silent judging gaze of others cutting in to you. This sucks, you might as well follow through and run into traffic anyways, it would hurt less. (You have lost some charisma)"""
4,re_lost_student_1,multiple check,"""1: Of course, its…""",,>=5,1,,,,,,,,,,,"""Using your general amount of knowledge, you are able to guide the young student to where they need to be on time. They give you a rushed thanks before running off. (You gained some charisma)"""
4,re_lost_student_2,multiple check,"""2: I genuinely don’t know""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""You respond that you genuinely have no idea where that room is and if a room like that even exists. Whatever they said had no numbers or was even in a language trembling English ( or human ). You shrug and they look a little disappointed."""
5,,Y/N Check,Cult Y Pass,,,,,,,,>= 80%,,,,,Yes,"""It kinda looks like they’re doing some dope ass shit. You decide to join them in their ritual. “Iä! iä! n'gha, ghaa!” Their leader cries in excitement as they throw their arms up in the air laughing maniacally. A member throws you a robe that so happens to be your size.  You put it on and join the circle holding hands with the other members are you mouth the unknowable words to their chants. Every candle in the room burns out at once. The circle below your feet seems to glow red and purple. The ground starts to rumble rhythmically, this is no earthquake. It seems as if something truly evil has awoken from underneath UCSB..."""
5,,Y/N Check,Cult Y Fail,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""Despite you wanting to join in on their ritual, the members seem to not agree with your “vibes” and they click their tongues in disgust. The leader shakes their head “Fhtagn, fhtagn…” It seems like you’re cramping their style and they’re asking you to leave. A hooded member grabs you by the arm and drags you to the door before tossing you outside. That almost felt a little insulting."""
5,,Y/N Check,Cult N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""You politely decline and ask where the exit is. The leader looks a little disappointed but seems to understand your hesitancy, they don’t want any hanger-ons after all, only true devotees. The leader gestures to one of the members who then politely escorts you out the building in a shared awkward silence. Well that sure happened."""
